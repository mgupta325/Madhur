ML assignment 1

To run the code :
1. Save the python files, two datasets in the same directory and then we can run it on any python 3 intrepeter/virtual environment.
2. The following python libraries must be installed:  scikit learn(sklearn),numpy,pandas,warnings,time.
3. Open the required python file and run it. (files named according to the classifier type and dataset to run on.)
 
Two datasets --->
1. digits.training.tra
2. tic-tac-toe.data

Python files:
ann.py- Neural network  classification for dataset 1   

ann1.py- Neural network classification for dataset 2

svm.py- Support vector machine classfication for dataset 1

svm1.py- Support vector machine classfication for dataset 2

dt.py- Decision tree classification for dataset 1

dt1.py- Decision tree classification for dataset 2

knn.py- K-nearest neighbors for dataset 1

knn1.py- K-nearest neighbors for dataset 2

boost.py- Boosting for dataset 1

boost1.py- Boosting for dataset 2
